# Flutter Training Repository

Welcome to this repository.

This project is part of a **structured Flutter training program** aimed at progressively introducing Flutter concepts through practical implementation.

---

## 📌 Repository Overview

This repository contains a **Flutter application** used as a learning and demonstration support.  
The project is organized in a way that allows a **step-by-step follow-up of the training sessions**.

Each branch represents:
- A **training session**
- A **progress milestone**
- The **state of the application** at the end of a given session

This approach enables clear tracking of the evolution of the application throughout the training cycle.

---

## 🗂 Project Structure & Progression

- The codebase evolves incrementally across branches
- Each branch reflects the work completed during a specific session
- Previously covered concepts can be reviewed at any time by switching branches

**Examples:**
- `first-step` → Initial setup and Flutter fundamentals
- Subsequent branches → UI components, navigation, state management, etc.

## 👤 Profile Summary

The application includes a **profile summary module** that presents key information about the creator.  
This module serves both as a functional feature and as an example of Flutter UI composition.

## 🎯 Objectives

The primary objectives of this repository are to:
- Support Flutter learning through practical examples
- Provide a clear and traceable progression across training sessions
- Serve as a technical reference during and after the training program
